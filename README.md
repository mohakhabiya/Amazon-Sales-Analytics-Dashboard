# Problem Statement:

Amazon faces challenges in understanding sales trends, profit distribution, and category-wise performance across different states and time periods. The goal is to create a dashboard that:

- Identifies high-performing categories and states contributing to profits.
- Highlights areas with negative profits for corrective action.
- Tracks sales trends over time to forecast future performance.
